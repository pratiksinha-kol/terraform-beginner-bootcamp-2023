    <p>You play as the title character throughout the game. Max is a modern-day New York undercover cop whose wife and baby daughter were brutally murdered and who has since been framed for a heinous crime. Thus begins his blood-soaked battle to find the truth--and to get revenge. The game has many superlative qualities, but one of the best things about it is how it actually plays. It's very easy to get into, as the control is smooth, simple, and responsive. You use the keyboard to make Max run in any direction and use the mouse to aim your weapons. The game's third-person camera perspective trails closely behind Max and gives a good sense of your surroundings, which is important since you'll need to move carefully through the game's enemy-infested environments.</p></i>
    <p><i>Even though, it was released in 24 July 2001, this game is still relevant for many aficionado. For that reason, it is also available on Android.
